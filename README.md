# CoverLetterFormatter
A tool to format a premade cover letter to be customized for a specific position.

## Usage
Select a template cover letter using the first "choose file" box. 
This template replaces "<Position Here>" with the Job Title, <Metro Area> with the location, <Company Name> with the name of the company, and <Availability Date> with the selected date.
Select an output file after filling out all of the relavant boxes, then click the Create Letter button. The program will then save a new cover letter in the chosen location.
